# 🎯 Detection Rule Tuning & False Positive Reduction

## 🧭 Project Summary

This project demonstrates how to tune SIEM detection rules to balance high detection accuracy with low false positive rates.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build initial noisy rule
* Measure alert volume
* Tune thresholds
* Compare results

---

## 🔍 Methodology

### Phase 1 — Noisy Rule

* Low threshold
* High alert volume

### Phase 2 — Tuned Rule

* Time bucketing
* Behavior-based logic
* Reduced noise

---

## 📊 Results

| Metric          | Before | After   |
| --------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Alerts/day      | High   | Low     |
| False positives | High   | Reduced |
| Analyst fatigue | Severe | Minimal |
